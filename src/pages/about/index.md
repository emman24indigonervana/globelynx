  Globelynx connects more experts to more broadcasters in more countries than
  anyone else.  News channels book with us every day because we deliver live
  interviews in broadcast-quality HD – professionally framed, lit and focussed -
  which is how TV producers want to see specialists presented.  The company was
  founded in 2001 and began offering financial experts live from trading floors
  in London’s financial district.  In 2011 Globelynx became part of the Press
  Association, the UK’s biggest and most trusted national news agency. The
  company began to expand into other sectors including education, working with
  some of the UK’s top universities, as well as some well renowned independent
  research centres like The Met Office.  The expansion continues overseas with
  clients added across Europe, APAC and North America as the company is
  increasing its global reach and underlining its position as The Home of the
  Expert.

  Not only does Globelynx provide the camera & technology to connect experts to
  broadcasters but we actively promote clients to news channels daily. Our team
  of journalists, led by an experienced TV news editor, create and maintain that
  link between the media and our clients so TV producers know where to turn for
  specialist comment on breaking and developing news stories.  The self-operated
  camera is easy to use, provides brand exposure from the client’s office and
  saves time for the expert - allowing them to be interviewed from the workplace
  rather than travelling to a TV studio.
heading_two: FOR BROADCASTERS
description_two: >-
  In a world where anyone can Skype for free, we offer a professional service
  which delivers a high standard of audio and vision for the broadcasters.  When
  experts are called upon to deliver insight on the day’s top news or business
  stories, how they’re presented should match the calibre of their analysis.
  This is what Globelynx delivers daily to news channels around the world.  In
  addition, the broadcaster saves on studio and satellite costs, as the camera
  is in the expert’s office and the signal is delivered over the internet, and
  saves resources, as the interview is delivered without the need to send a TV
  camera crew or journalist.
