Since going live their academics and experts have been called upon to talk about issues ranging from doping in athletics to Mein Kampf. BBC, Sky News and CNBC are just some of the news channels that have benefited from the universities' expertise.



Dr David Lowe is a regular media contributor at Liverpool John Moores University and has had several requests for interviews through the Globelynx camera.



He said, "Having the camera at LJMU has opened up the opportunity to conduct interviews with television stations based outside the UK.



"Also it is very useful to have the camera based at my campus as it saves time travelling to other television studios, especially those based in Media City."



Both Loughborough and Liverpool John Moore's join an illustrious group of European universities equipped with a Globelynx Camera.



In the coming months both Coventry University and St. Andrew's are set to become TV-ready when their Broadcasting Units go live.
