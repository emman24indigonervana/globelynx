  At a time of political intrigue, heightened threat levels and a redrawing of
  international relations, four more insightful organisations have joined the
  Globelynx network:


  Financial Times (Washington Bureau), St Andrews University, University of East
  Anglia and Northumbria University.


  Each of them now has an inhouse studio for broadcast interviews, and their
  academics, journalists and political experts are available for timely analysis
  on breaking news stories.

**Insight into US politics**



As America enters a new era under Trump’s leadership, Globelynx offers broadcasters a direct line of communication from the political centre of the USA. Financial Times journalists based in Washington DC are now available at a moment’s notice from their in-house Globelynx camera and connection.



The transition from Obama to Trump could take the world into unchartered territory and FT journalists and reporters will be able to share their unique perspective.



This broadcasting window into Capitol Hill is Globelynx’s first American-based camera to go live on the network. The Financial Times San Francisco bureau will soon come online, and Energy Aspects analysts will also be available for comment on the oil and energy sector from One World Trade Centre in New York City.



**University across the UK**



Scotland’s first university, St Andrews becomes the first Scottish institution to join the Globelynx network, adding a wealth of academic talent. Rated the third best university in the UK, broadcasters now have instant access to St Andrews despite its remote location. St Andrews contains the world renowned Centre for Terrorism and Political Violence and has leading research and teaching staff in its International Relations and Middle Eastern faculties. Never has the need for authoritative comment in these fields been greater than in today’s climate.



Northumbria University is situated in the heart of Newcastle city centre. They can provide research that focuses on relevant, current and real issues; everything from homelessness to family law, race relations to care in the community.



The University of East Anglia is another new addition to the network, bringing rural East Anglia to the world’s news channels. Specialisms range from health and nutrition, to the environment and responses to climate change, as well as investigating competition and regulation. It’s an outward looking and innovative research institution, with a wide range of media trained experts ready for broadcast interviews.
