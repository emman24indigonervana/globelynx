In Europe, Globelynx is offering broadcasters direct live links into two major economic institutions. With a camera position at Euronext Paris, Europe's second-largest stock exchange, visiting CEOs, traders and reporters are available for live and pre-recorded interviews.



Broadcasters also now have direct access to industry experts based within the Swiss bank UBS, based in Zurich.



The connections to experts extend further east now thanks to two new live positions in Asia.



Fidelity International offers experts and analysts direct from their offices in Hong Kong while ADS Securities provide views and insight from their base in Abu Dhabi.
