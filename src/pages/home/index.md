      "I found the whole process of implementing Globelynx - from the initial
      order through to installation - to be slick, straightforward and seamless,
      with fantastic support from  everybody involved. An additional bonus was
      the industry insight and guidance that we  received in getting started -
      which helped us to secure 25 TV interviews in our first six weeks of
      operation, across networks including the BBC, Sky, ITV, CNBC and
      France24."
