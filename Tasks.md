## What's this week's priority?

## Tasks

- [ ] Replace all images sourced from online searches

- [ ] Replace the welcome video on the top of the site (currently waiting on Globelynx to send across the latest video)

- [/] Remove the popular search buttons below the search bar throughout the site

- [x] Amend the tag line copy above the search bar on the homepage and throughout ( Home of the expert--- A community connecting experts to global broadcaster- search bar.)

- [ ]  The right icon acts as a login/logout button and left icon is to help the expert to go back to their hub area to view and edit their profile and booking.  Kenny, let me know if they are necessary or can be removed?

- [ ] We would like to remove the ‘About’ section on the homepage and swap with an interactive map of where our cameras are located. We want this to be interactive rather than a static picture of a map. (This is fine, and good to do, but Kenny would need to implement the map and how it would be interactive. Kenny, can you set this up so then it would be a series of dots and when you hover over a dot, it would show a square speech bubble to show the expert face, name, specialism and email icon please. Let me know if unsure.)

- [/] We would like to add a plug in on the side as you scroll down ‘Join the community’. (I assume you have this in hand to have the right plugin for your code? I assume its a teamchat plugin.)

- [ ] Contact section needs to line up better

- [x] Navigation Menu When you hover over the list of tabs can the titles get larger 

- [ ] Experts Page When you hit the expert page, we would like to see a list of our top 100 expert. This needs to change every month automatically. This page should be titled ‘top 100’

- [ ]  When you hit the expert page, we would like to see a list of our top 100 expert. This needs to change every month automatically. This page should be titled ‘top 100'

(@Amal Taher I would say not to this item. The reason is that I do not know this would work? When you do a search, it woudl need to disappear to show correct results.  If you show the top 100, I am not sure what value that would be as there is a lot to go through and what would it achieve to the user.  Also putting a title of top 100 is a bit ugly. I would have to say not to this one I am afraid. You can have a seperate page called Top100, but it will be a literal index of experts that would be presented in the same way as the new expert index page.)

- [x] Could we add the language filter again below ‘Specialisms’

- [ ]  Click on the left project categories to see the animation for the new results.  Can you copy this when using the search and left filters for the globelynx filters.

- [ ] We need to better design the expert’s profile. There are not a lot of businesses similar to Globelynx, so its hard to get a feel of what others are doing. So I researched businesses that have ‘expert’ pages. It seems a lot are using dahsboard type set-up- see below.
