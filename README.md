## Tasks
- [x] Tags under the search bar need rollover state

- [x] I like how the tags change into a deeper level when selected. Can you have the categories to be more like chapter headings, so that when you click through it makes more sense? What is the rule for how many to display when selected?

- [x] Logo is fuzzy

- [x] The login icons on the right are missing

- [x] News ticker tape is not running, its fade in and out, should be across the screen.

- [x] Can the central search bar (tags) be more centred on the video background area

- [x] Can the down arrow move more to be clearer

- [x] Bring up the about us section closer to the arrow. Key thing is the spacing between elements to be equal

Is there a character limit? Need to remove the last comma

- [x] Testimonials are not fading in and out, its static on 1

- [x] Need rollover states on footer links

- [x] Twitter feed at the bottom is a graphic, not a real feed

- [x] email and telephone icons in the footer and text is too big, reduce in size and align with last footer link on the left hand side.

- [x] Top search area throughout the site (past homepage) is too tall, needs to be tighter towards the top. If you see the design, you do not see the background lady's hands, only the tops of her fingers. I can see its reponsive, but is it possible. To keep the image static and just  lock the height?

- [x] On the search index view, the titles on the left filter is too thick and should be thinner, entered and more padding between the letters.

- [x] Can you add more spacing between the tick box and the text to the right (and padding between the words and the number of people involved in that section

- [x] Please make tick boxes bigger

- [x] There should be a plus icon to show more options, also it should show all options, I have to click 'Show More' several times

- [x] There should be a key line seperator between each type of filter

- [?] On the expert images, is there an example to showcase a video demo of the export

- [x] The job descriptions should be bottom aligned to the expert box

- [x] The name should be below the expertise title. If you see the design, the focus is now on what are they an expert of, not who they are

- [x] There is some bad data, some experts do not have an image, should be a placeholder image of Logo

- [x] If the data is wrong, it makes gaps in the list, please scroll down the list view to see

- [x] Please animate the forms, so that the text inside the field shrinks and moves on top of the field

- [x] Need more padding in the footer, there should be more space between the top of the footer and the Contact title

- [x] Font headings in the summary section is too thick, please reduce font weight

- [x] Missing return to search results button (and it should be based on their original search)

- [~] Product index does not look complete? There are no products on the list view. And remove featured products title

- [~] On product detail, the STATS title should be bigger and wrong cloud

- [~] test data for products at the moment

- [x] Please put in google map in contact page, above the contact box and below search box, and make it full bleed.
